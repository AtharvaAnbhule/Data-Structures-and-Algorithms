## About

This repository features implementations of a variety of data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

The purpose of this project is to provide clear and efficient implementations of these data structures to aid in understanding their functionality and use cases.

## Languages Used

- C

## Data Structures Overview

The implementations are organized into folders by data structure type. Each folder contains:
- **Implementation Code**: The C source files for the data structure.
- **Example Usage**: Sample code demonstrating how to use the data structure.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Comments on the time and space complexity of the operations (if applicable).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-in-c.git
   cd data-structures-in-c
   gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
